# Courses Panel Lab

This project has the objective to create a platform where courses from various types of education can be distributed by instructors.

# Concept

Courses are pre-recorder by instructors and this platform is their marketplace. Every instructor can define his own price and give discount coupons if he wants to.
Every course should at least have one free-to-watch video so students can see if instructor fulfills their requirements.
Required language is English, no others are allowed. This is done to prevent uneven distribution of courses.

### Home Page

Home page should randomize the placement of courses regardless of their theme.

### Course Page

When potential student clicks a course link on the home page it takes him to the customized page for the course.

This page should allow student to watch the free-to-watch video, see the price, see the number of hours available in the course and other important details...

Also, it should allow student to purchase the said course and input the coupon code if he has it.

### Learner Page

When student buys the course and clicks on the "begin learning" it should take him to this page.

The list of videos appears and the first plays automatically. Something like YouTube playlist.

### Client area page

On this page student/instructor can see their purchased/created courses.

If student sees this page it should allow him to see the progress of every course.

If instructor sees this page it should allow him to view the total revenue of each course respectively and the total amount earned from it.

Also this page should allow the said user to update their personal information if they want to.

## Programming concepts

### This app uses Node.js, EJS, MongoDB, Morgan, dotenv, Express.js. No other libraries or any external code.

The entire app database is done in MongoDB and is being controlled by the mongoose js library.
